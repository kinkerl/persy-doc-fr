Installation
=================================

If you can, install the debian package. It will take care of "all" problems. 
You can find the latest version of persy in a ppa repository on launchpad.
To add this repository to your Ubuntu installation, just run the following commad (or you can use the software sources userinterface):

.. code-block:: bash
  :linenos:

   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tmassassin/ppa

After you added the repository, you can install persy if you click on this `apt link (apt://persy) <apt://persy>`_, over the software center or with the command line:


.. code-block:: bash
  :linenos:

   sudo aptitude install persy

If you are not running Ubuntu or want to direct download the debian or the source package, please go to https://launchpad.net/~tmassassin/+archive/ppa/+packages

.. note::

   You can get the lastet version from github. These may not work at all but are bleeding edge and contain the newest features: ``git clone git://github.com/kinkerl/persy.git`` 


Extract the latest source package into your favorite location.
You may want to the developer documentation for the required dependencies. If you dont, configure hopefully will tell you whats missing.
Inside of the extracted package, run the following commands to install persy.

.. code-block:: bash
  :linenos:

   ./configure
   make
   make install


After the installaton you will have to do some configuraton in the persy settings menu depending on your environment, needs and whishes
