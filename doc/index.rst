   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Bonjour! Welcome to persy's documentation!
=============================================
persy is an automated incremental backup tool for your personal files and folders.
It also has the ability to synchronize your folders over multiple machines.
So, it is comparable to dropbox_ and ubuntuone_ but with one major difference: 
you dont need a user account in a cloud in the internet where you dont really know where your stuff is and who may have access to it. 

With persy, you control every step and station in the process but persy tries to keep most of the annoying things out of the way.
If you just want to backup your files and save nearly every step you do, run persy and add your folders to persy in the "backup" settings tab. 
If you want to sychronize your files, all you need is a server with ssh and git (in your local network or remote in the internet doesnt matter). 
I have a old pc here in my local network for example. Give persy the server data it needs, follow the configuration, enable remote synchronization and there you go!

If you are not looking at the online version of the documentation, you can find the most recent version at: http://persy.digitalkultur.net

.. note::

   persy is considered feature complete. I will fix bugs but not add new features. If you think persy is missing anything or want to contribute just write me a message.

.. warning::

   if something blows up, you might need some experience with git. If you are happy with solving a conflict in git: go ahead and have fun with persy!
